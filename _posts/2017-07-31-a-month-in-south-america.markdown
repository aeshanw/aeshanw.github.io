Its been over an year since I got back for my sabbatical trip to South America (Argentina, Chile, Peru ,Bolivia and half a day in Brazil). Its been slow progress but I've finally completed the final blog post of that trip.

You can find a list of all [the related posts here](/tag/south-america).

My motivation for writing the posts was partly to document my travels and partly to share my experience so that others who might embark on a similar route might avoid some of the pitfalls I encountered on my trip.

I've omitted the exact costs as :

* I've forgotten the exact values
* Not useful as the inflation in these countries make them irrelevant overtime anyway.

Though I try to make comparisons whenever possible to give the reader a rough gauge.

Although I've documented all the travel posts of my trip I've still got 2 pending blog posts on 2 topics related to the trip but not restrained to one location:

* Crime safety & risk
* Payments

With my trip posts finally concluded I now release this material to a wider audience. I hope you find it informative and (if you intend on visiting) useful. It was an exhausting yet rewarding  experience and hopefully the posts capture this in sufficient detail.
